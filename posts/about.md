Hi! I'm Thiago Rodrigues, an electrical engineer and developer from Brazil.

I've been working on the design, maintenance, and commissioning of electrical systems in data centers and industrial plants for over 7 years. 

I fell in love with programming in college and have been passionate about writing code to solve problems ever since, sometimes problems ~~I don't need to solve~~. I also make iOS and macOS apps for fun.

I moved to Appleton, WI in 2019, and where I have been functioning thanks to 300-600ml of good coffee every day.
