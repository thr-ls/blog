Here are some of my public active projects and code I put out there for everyone to use, contribute to, and ~~learn~~ from.

- [Gosos (Save Our Services](https://github.com/thr-ls/gosos) : A simple CLI tool for monitoring website and API statuses.
- [MuSync](https://github.com/thr-ls/musync): MuSync is a basic Rust-based CLI tool to synchronize your local music library with a Subsonic API server (Navidrome in my case). It processes your music collection, compares it with a remote API, and uploads missing albums.
